<h1>Hey there! And Welcome to my GitHub 😁</h1>
==================================================================

I'm an Data Scientist with a passion for exploring the intersection of numbers, finance, and the mysteries of the universe. 🌌✨ Originally from sunny Casablanca 🌞, Morocco 🇲🇦, I embarked on an incredible academic journey that took me from the breathtaking landscapes of Switzerland in Lausanne 🇨🇭, where I delved into the depths of theoretical physics. 🏔️🔭 Driven by curiosity, I further expanded my knowledge and skills in computational finance in the chilly yet invigorating city of Montreal, Canada. 🍁💼 When I'm not crunching numbers or unraveling complex data, you'll often find me lacing up my hiking boots, ready to conquer the highest peaks and immerse myself in the serenity of nature. There's something truly magical about camping amidst the towering mountains! ⛰️🏕️

Let's connect and explore how we can leverage data science to unlock fascinating insights and create meaningful impact together. Feel free to reach out—I'm always up for a chat about work, adventures, or anything that piques your interest! ✉️🌟
